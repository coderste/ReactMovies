# Learning React

Learning React JS by developing that allows you to find the best Movies by filtering by date, genre, rating and runtime all by using [The Movie DB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en)

## Tutorial

The tutorial used is located at [CodeCamps](https://sweetpumpkins.codecamps.com/)

## Update

So I think I am finished building this now - although the tutorial has couple of more things to do like:

* Movie Pagination
* A Movie Page
* Presisting Data in the Local Storage

This was more of a learning process for me on how to setup ReactJS with a custom folder structure instead of using the `create-react-app` package.

I also learnt alot about ES6/7 while building this fun little project, and has made me want to use React in more of my projects.
